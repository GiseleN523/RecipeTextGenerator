# RecipeTextGenerator

This project was written in Winter of 2025 for my Creative Coding and Generative AI class. Random recipes are generated using the Tracery Grammar; every recipe contains a 2-3 word title, one or more steps involving dry ingredients, one or more steps involving wet ingredients, and instructions to bake. Words were added by me as well as sourced from "Chocolate and Cocoa Recipes and Home Made Candy Recipes" by Parloa and Hill, and "The Bread and Biscuit Baker's and Sugar-Boiler's Assistant" by Robert Wells (both public domain). The P5 library was used for graphics. Refresh the page to get a new recipe every time!
